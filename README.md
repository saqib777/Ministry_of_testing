# Ministry_of_testing

</div>

A comprehensive collection of **manual and functional test cases** designed for practice sites such as [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/), [TestSheepNZ](https://testsheepnz.github.io/), and others used in the testing community.

This repository is part of a continuous learning initiative to strengthen real-world testing skills by documenting **detailed test scenarios**, **steps**, **expected results**, and **validation techniques** for various web applications.
